It reads: \n'Welcome to the maze! You're now trapped in what we call room 1 which is located at the start of the maze. Your objective is to get to the last room. \n\nTo be able to do that you must find the way forward. By moving, breaking or opening objects in your way you'll find new information on how to make your progress through the maze. \nIf you find things that might be to later usage you're able to do so by picking them up. \n\nTo see more information about this maze, just type 'help'. Good luck!' \n\n---",
